In this project, I implement some classification models and compare their decision boundaries after tuning their hyperparameters. 

Classification Models from scratch: KNN and Decision Trees
Classifications Models implemented using sklearn: Linear Kernel SVM, Polynomial Kernel SVM, RBF Kernel SVM

All the models and their evaluations are in the models.ipynb files.
